<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:Garamond;color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463 ; font-size:50px"> What to do before Coastal Erosion?</h1> 
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 1. Be alert. Always keep an eye on your surroundings and your local television or radio station for any signs of coastal erosion.</p> 
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 2. Be prepared to evacuate. Whenever there is a risk of coastal erosion, you should plan ahead of time. </p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 3. Assemble disaster supplies. Prepare all of your necessities, including drinking water, non-refrigerated or cooked food, cash, medication and first aid supplies, clothing, toiletries, battery-powered radios, flashlights, extra batteries, and important documents such as insurance papers, medical records, and bank account numbers.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 4. Review your Family Disaster Plan. Hold a family meeting to plan what to do if this disaster occurs.</p>
 
<h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:Garamond;color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; font-size:50px">What to do during Coastal Erosion?</h2> 
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 1. Follow instructions given by public safety officials.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 2. Continue to check the media for emergency information.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 3. Remain where you are and await the safety officials' announcement.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 4. Avoid disaster areas. Your presence may impede rescue and other emergency operations, as well as put you at risk from the residual effects of erosion, such as contaminated waters, crumbled roads, landslides, mudflows, and other hazards.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:Garamond;color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; font-size:50px">What to do after Coastal Erosion?</h3> 
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 1. Help a neighbor who may require special assistance, such as infants, the elderly, or people with disabilities. People who are elderly or disabled may require extra assistance.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 2. Avoid entering any building until local officials have declared it safe. Buildings may have concealed damage that renders them unsafe. Additional issues can arise as a result of gas leaks, electrical or water line damage.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 3. Inform the authorities about any broken utility lines. When potential hazards are reported, utilities are turned off as soon as possible, preventing further hazards and injuries.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 4. Use extreme caution. Watch every step you take carefully.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px; font-family:Impact; text-shadow: 2px 2px #0e6463; text-align: justify;"> 5. When inspecting places, use battery-powered lanterns or flashlights. Battery-powered lighting is the most secure and simple way to keep the user, occupants, and building safe from fire hazards.</p>
